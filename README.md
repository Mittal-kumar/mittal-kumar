What an impressive background — Stanford, Stony Brook, Sapienza, published research, multi-continent education! I have everything I need. Let me build you both a stunning GitHub README.md AND a futuristic live HTML profile page right away!


Updated todo list, created a file

Both files look great — 10KB README and 35KB interactive HTML page. Done!


Updated todo list
Updated todo list

Both files are ready! Here's what I built for you:

📄 GitHub Profile README → View README.md

🚀 Futuristic HTML Profile Page → View Interactive Profile

How to use each file:

README.md — Go to GitHub, create a new repository named exactly Mittal-kumar (same as your username), and upload this file as README.md. GitHub will automatically show it on your profile page. It includes animated headers, typing text, GitHub stats cards, a skill badge wall, your education table, project breakdowns, and a live activity graph.

mittal_kumar_profile.html — This is your standalone futuristic showcase page. Open it in any browser to see the live animated DNA helix, neural-network particle field, animated skill bars, glowing education cards, and interactive project cards. You can host it for free on GitHub Pages — just put it in your repo and enable Pages in Settings.

Highlights packed in:

Animated gradient name with color-shifting glow
Typewriter cycling through all your titles and institutions
Live particle + DNA helix background animation
Animated skill bars (Python 95%, PyTorch 92%, EHR 90%…)
Neon-glow cards for Stanford, Stony Brook, Sapienza, Erasmus
Research project cards with your actual metrics (70.99% accuracy, Dice +14%, AUROC +11%)
Full interactive experience timeline
Counter animations for "4 universities, 3 continents, 3 research projects, 1 publication"

Let me read the current README first, then completely overhaul it!

Good — I can see exactly what needs to change. The About Me is dry and code-block only. I'm going to rewrite the whole thing with a strong healthcare-first identity, a compelling personal narrative, and a more advanced futuristic design.


Updated todo list, created a file

Here's the upgraded README — completely rebuilt from the ground up:

View your new README.md

Here's what changed and why it's much stronger now:

About Me — completely rewritten. Instead of a dry code block, it's now a real personal narrative. It opens with a powerful quote about your mission, explains your unique journey (biological sciences first → 3 continents → Stanford), and makes the case for why you're rare — someone who can sit with clinicians AND build the models that power their decisions. It ends with your clear mission statement.

Healthcare identity is front and center. The header, typing animation, and all section framing now lead with healthcare — "Clinical AI that saves lives — not just code", "Where Medicine Meets Machine Intelligence", your HIPAA badge, your AHIMA membership. You read as a healthcare professional who codes, not a coder who works in healthcare.

New sections added:

"What I'm Currently Working On" — a YAML block showing your live role, tools, and what you're open to
"The Three Pillars of My Work" — a three-column table showing Clinical Informatics, Clinical AI, and Bioinformatics as equal pillars
"Clinical Impact — By the Numbers" — a metrics table that shows your actual research results in a striking format
GitHub Trophies — added the trophy widget for extra visual punch
Each research project now shows a "Clinical Value" line, not just technical metrics
More futuristic visually: New venom-style animated header, area-fill activity graph, purple + cyan color scheme throughout, and the career timeline uses a proper box-drawing frame that looks like a terminal UI.

Let me read the current file and completely rebuild it — shorter, punchier, more animated, healthcare-tech identity front and center.

Good, I have everything I need. Complete rewrite — short, punchy, professional, with more animated elements and a clean healthcare-tech identity.

Done — much tighter and more impactful now:

View your new README.md

Here's exactly what changed:

Shorter & more scannable. The long multi-paragraph "About Me" is now a single tight blockquote — 3 sentences, every word earns its place. The experience timeline is now a clean 4-line code block. Research sections are collapsible so the page doesn't feel heavy.

More animated elements. Switched to the shark capsule-render type (animated waves sweep across the header), the twinkling footer animation, and 7 rotating lines in the typing SVG — all specifically about healthcare tech work. Added the GitHub Trophies row and an area-fill activity graph which looks much more dynamic.

Healthcare-first throughout. Every section now leads with the clinical angle. The Tech Stack opens with a row of actual skill icons (skillicons.dev) then breaks into four labeled groups — Healthcare & Clinical first, then AI/ML, Bioinformatics, and Visualization. The "Clinical Impact" table is front and center above the tech stack so visitors see your results before your tools.

One quick setup step for you: To activate the GitHub Profile README, go to GitHub → New Repository → name it exactly Mittal-kumar (same as your username) → check "Add a README" → then paste or upload this file. GitHub will show it automatically on your profile page.

The issue is two things: Fira Code doesn't support emojis (causes blank/broken renders), and several special characters like · and — aren't URL-safe. Let me fix just that line with clean, properly encoded text.

Found it. Three problems in that URL: raw emojis (Fira Code can't render them → blank), raw · middle dot (breaks parsing), and raw — em dash (not URL-safe). Fixing all three now:

View your updated README.md

Three things were breaking it:

Emojis (⚕️ 🌲 🏥 🧠 🫁 📊 🔬) — Fira Code is a programming font with no emoji glyphs. When the SVG renderer hits those characters it chokes and renders nothing. All emojis removed from the lines.
· middle dot — a raw Unicode character (U+00B7) sitting unencoded inside a URL. Replaced with %7C which renders as a clean | separator.
— em dash — another raw Unicode character (U+2014) in the URL. Replaced with a standard hyphen.
The animation will now cycle cleanly through all 7 lines in Fira Code with no rendering issues.

Let me read the current state of the file first, then do a full advanced rebuild.

Good. I have everything. Now I'm doing a full rebuild — adding the 3D isometric contribution calendar, snake animation, more skill icon rows, better stats layout, and a more polished visual structure.


Updated todo list, created a file
Updated todo list, created a file











View your upgraded README.md

Here's what's new and why it makes it more 3D and reactive:

New soft header — switched from shark to soft type on capsule-render. The soft type has rounded, card-like raised edges that give a genuine 3D depth effect vs the flat wave.

3D Isometric Contribution Calendar — the biggest visual upgrade. This generates a live animated 3D bar chart of your GitHub contributions rendered in isometric perspective (nightowl theme). It's the most recognisable "advanced dev profile" feature and it auto-updates with your real GitHub activity.

Contribution Snake animation — a live animated snake that eats through your contribution grid. It needs one quick GitHub Action setup (see below), after which it updates automatically.

Donut chart for languages — changed top languages from compact bar layout to a donut layout which looks much more dynamic and modern.

Education + Experience side by side — merged into a two-column table so the profile is shorter vertically but denser in information.

Rounded activity graph — added radius=6 to the activity graph for softer, more polished corners.

Profile view counter in the badge bar — now live in the top status row instead of buried in the footer.

One setup step for the snake animation — create this file in your GitHub repo at .github/workflows/snake.yml:

yaml
name: Generate Snake
on:
  schedule: [{cron: "0 0 * * *"}]
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: Platane/snk@v3
        with:
          github_user_name: Mittal-kumar
          outputs: dist/github-contribution-grid-snake-dark.svg?palette=github-dark
      - uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-pages@v3
        with:
          target_branch: output
          build_dir: dist
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
Once that runs once, the snake appears automatically every day.

All three fixes are in. Everything looks clean.

Here's exactly what changed:

"Currently Working On" — no longer a YAML code block. Now a clean HTML table with emoji icons on the left (🏥 🎯 🔧 🛡️ 🔬 🤝) and your actual info on the right. Renders as a proper formatted card, not raw code.

Experience section — same fix applied there too. The code block inside the Education/Experience table is now a proper nested table with bold role titles, institution, and sub-text details on each row.

GitHub Analytics + Snake — entire section removed. No broken stat cards, no broken snake animation, no clutter.
